/*RESTful Web APIs

The essence of the REST architecture comprises a client and a server.
The REST API allows diverse systems to connect and send/receive data in the direct way.
The server accepts the incoming messages, then replies to it, while the client creates the
connection, then delivers messages to the server.
The RESTful client would be an HTTP client, and the RESTful server would be the HTTP server.
Each and every REST API call has a relationship between an HTTP verb and the URL.
The reserves (data or business logic) in the database in an application can be defined with an
API endpoint in the REST.
